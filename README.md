# AI Exam

## Overview

This task involves building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict California housing prices using the dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices). The performance of the ANN model will be compared against two classical Machine Learning models.

## Repository Structure

In this repository build the following notebooks:

1. **`ann_model.ipynb`**: Implementation of the ANN model.
2. **`ml_[model 1].ipynb`**: Implementation of the first classical ML model.
3. **`ml_[model 2].ipynb`**: Implementation of the second classical ML model.
4. [optional] **`data_cleaning_preprocessing.ipynb`**: Notebook for data cleaning and preprocessing.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this task is the California housing prices dataset. You can access it directly from Kaggle using the following link: [California Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices).

## Steps to Complete the Task

1. Preprocess the dataset to ensure it is ready for model training.
2. Train an ANN model to predict housing prices.
3. Train two classical ML models for comparison.
4. Evaluate all models using relevant metrics.
5. Document findings in the README file.

## Findings

The performance of the models is summarized as follows:

- **ANN Model**: [Add evaluation metric results]
- **Classical ML Model 1**: [Add evaluation metric results]
- **Classical ML Model 2**: [Add evaluation metric results]
